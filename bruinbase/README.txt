Project 2D
Reason for probable 50% change in code in BTreeNode and BTreeIndex:
1. We changed a lot of our functions in BTreeNode.cc because they weren't working correctly.
2. We cleaned up the code (by cleaning up uncessary comments and old code)
3. We changed BTreeIndex.cc because like #1, we found many bugs in our code which didn't work.
4. Also, a lot of newlines / indentation may cause the 50% difference.

Final project turned in.

Tested on xsmall, small, medium, large, xlarge

Not 100% sure a 3 level tree works correctly (xlarge).
