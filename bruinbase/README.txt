Project 2b
Implemented bTreeNode.cc, but not have 100% tested it.

Everything compiles.

There's a possibility that we would have to edit this a little for part C/D.

Project 2a
We assumed that WITH INDEX was false. 

We were able to get everything copied and diff'ing our .tbl with the movie.tbl, we get nothing as output.

I'm not sure if we were supposed to do error checking, and what were we supposed to do if it failed.
There were a few error checking we did and we returned based off of Bruinbase.h.
